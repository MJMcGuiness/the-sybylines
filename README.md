# The Sybyline

## by MJ McGuiness

What does it mean when magic suddenly appears in a non-magical
world? This is the question confronting government functionaries
(and spies) Josip Franson and Margerai Dokai when the Sybyline,
a clan of mysterious mages, arrive in the pre-industrial nation
of Emor. The Sybyline predict the weather and cure diseases, but
is this because they also control the weather and cause plagues?
Could they be agents of the dreaded despotism of Anihc? Josip
and his longed-for love, Margerai, must discover whether the
Sybyline are really benevolent, or if their good works are cover
for sinister ends. As Josip and Margerai struggle to understand
the Sybyline’s motives, greed, suspicion, betrayal, and violence
— not magic — thwart their efforts. Emor devolves into chaos
just as Josip and Margerai are forced into a journey on the high
seas to faraway islands with the two most dangerous Sybyline
women as companions.
