        <p class="exerpt">
          “Ah, Josip, you’re finally here. Come, sit.” Premier Camylin Corenne,
          a tall, gaunt woman, somewhere between middle aged and elderly, was
          seated at a small breakfast table across the room, beside a window
          overlooking her private garden. Despite the evident rush to see him,
          Camilyn did not say anything as Josip seated himself, but quietly
          sipped her bica while staring out the window. Her breakfast tray was
          gone, and the table was strewn with papers. She had obviously been up
          and working for some time. Blast it, I should have been earlier, today
          of all days. Josip noticed that Camylin’s hand was visibly shaking as
          she set her bica cup back on the table. What is that about? “I have
          wonderful news.” Josip reached for his portfolio. “All the evidence we
          need against that scoundrel Davos.” “I’m anxious to hear it, Josip,
          but it will have to wait.” “Pardon? Is there some emergency I’m not
          aware of?” “Yes….no. I don’t know.” Camylin stared out the window
          briefly then reached for her bica, only to set it down immediately,
          her hand shaking uncontrollably. “Camylin…what’s the matter?” Josip
          reached across the table and placed his hand on hers to stop the
          trembling. “The Sybyline came to see me this morning, as soon as I was
          awake.” Josip tightened his grip on her hand. “The Sybyline? What did
          they want?” “You!” Camylin stared out the window, unable to look Josip
          in the eye. “They have some task for you, Josip. They insist on seeing
          you immediately.” Josip took a deep breath. By the Night. What could
          the Sybyline possibly want with me? “I’m sure it’s nothing.” It must
          be nothing. “Look, I don’t trust them any more than you, but for the
          few months they’ve been in Emor they haven’t done anything harmful, or
          even threatening. Predicting the weather and showing us how to control
          some diseases is the exact opposite in fact.” Josip had enough
          self-awareness to know he was calming himself with these words as much
          as he was trying to calm Camylin. Being personally summoned by a clan
          of magicians who had recently appeared out of nowhere was not an
          expected, or welcome development. “I’ll go to them and do whatever
          little task it is they want. Don’t worry about me.” “But I am worried,
          Josip. I think they have powers—powers we can’t even conceive of—far
          beyond predicting the weather or curing diseases. What if they can
          control the weather, not just predict it? What if they can cause
          plagues as easily as they cure diseases? “Bah, what would make you say
          such a thing?” “They threatened as much this morning.” “What? How so?”
          “They said they needed money for this task they want you to do. Lots
          of money. Thousands of tal. I balked at the amount, told them the
          Treasurer wouldn’t release such an amount on my word alone. They
          replied that the treasury could disappear completely if they predicted
          a turns-long drought. They said famine would grip all of Emor if they
          predicted such a drought.” “By the Night., they’re extorting us. And
          you believe them?” “I have to. Their predictions are never wrong. They
          tell us the very hour when rains will come. How could they do this if
          they weren’t controlling the weather?” Josip looked away, staring
          blankly at the floor. How could I have ignored the threat the Sybyline
          represent? I’m a fool. Not the right hand of the Premier, but a fool.
          And now the Sybyline want me. “Let’s not jump to conclusions. I’ll go
          see what they want. I’ve ignored them long enough. This may be an
          opportunity to ferret out who they are and what they’re about. Don’t
          worry.” “Worrying is my job, you know. But you’re right. We’ve not
          asked enough questions of the Sybyline and we’ve been entirely too
          accepting of their gifts. I fear there may be many strings attached.”
          She took Josip’s hand in both of her own. “Please be careful, Josip.
          They’re cunning. If you’re caught poking into their affairs there is
          no telling what they might do. Mother Above, I pray they aren’t agents
          of the Anihceans.” Josip’s eyes opened wide. I am a fool. A complete,
          utter fool. If the Sybyline are agents of Anihc, and they have the
          powers Camylin suspects, this is not just a threat to me, it’s an
          existential crisis for all Emor. Thank the Mother Above, Anihc is on
          the far side of the world. But is that far enough? “Just because
          everyone believes Anihc is intent on enslaving the entire world
          doesn’t make it so. After all, Anihc is just as mysterious as the
          Sybyline in many ways.” Again, Josip realized he was saying this to
          calm himself. No wonder Camylin’s hands were shaking.
